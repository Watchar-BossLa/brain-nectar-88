# Study Bee Enhancement Plans

This directory contains detailed plans for enhancing the Study Bee multi-subject learning platform. These plans outline the implementation of new features, improvements to existing features, and the addition of new subjects.

## Plan Overview

### Interactive Elements

These plans detail the implementation of interactive elements for each subject:

- [Mathematics Interactive Elements](./mathematics-interactive-elements.md)
- [Physics Interactive Elements](./physics-interactive-elements.md)
- [Chemistry Interactive Elements](./chemistry-interactive-elements.md)
- [Data Science Interactive Elements](./data-science-interactive-elements.md)
- [Finance Interactive Elements](./finance-interactive-elements.md)

### API Integration

This plan outlines the implementation of real API calls to replace the mock data:

- [Real API Implementation](./real-api-implementation.md)

### Additional Subjects

This plan details the addition of new subjects to the platform:

- [Additional Subjects](./additional-subjects.md)

### Master Implementation Plan

This plan combines all the enhancement plans into a comprehensive implementation strategy:

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these enhancements, follow these guidelines:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement features incrementally, starting with the most basic functionality and adding more complex features over time.

2. **Testing**: Write tests for each new feature before implementing it. This ensures that the feature works as expected and helps prevent regressions.

3. **Documentation**: Document each new feature, including its purpose, how to use it, and any dependencies or limitations.

4. **Code Quality**: Follow the established coding standards and best practices. Use ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code style.

5. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of each new feature. Use profiling tools to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

6. **Accessibility**: Ensure that all new features are accessible to users with disabilities. Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

7. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that all new features work well on different screen sizes and devices.

8. **Browser Compatibility**: Test new features on different browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Getting Started

To start implementing these enhancements:

1. Review the master implementation plan to understand the overall strategy.
2. Choose a specific enhancement to implement based on the current phase.
3. Create a new branch for the enhancement.
4. Implement the enhancement following the guidelines above.
5. Create a pull request for review.
6. After approval, merge the enhancement into the main branch.

## Contributing

When contributing to these enhancements:

1. Discuss major changes with the team before implementing them.
2. Update the relevant plan documents if you make significant changes to the implementation strategy.
3. Keep the team informed of your progress and any challenges you encounter.
4. Seek help when needed and offer help to others when possible.

## Timeline

The implementation of these enhancements is expected to take approximately 20 weeks, divided into four phases:

- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-5): Core Interactive Elements
- Phase 2 (Weeks 6-10): API Integration
- Phase 3 (Weeks 11-15): Additional Subjects
- Phase 4 (Weeks 16-20): Advanced Features and Optimization

See the [Master Implementation Plan](./master-implementation-plan.md) for more details on the timeline.
