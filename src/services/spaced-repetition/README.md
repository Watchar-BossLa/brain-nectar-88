# Adaptive Spaced Repetition System

The Adaptive Spaced Repetition System is an advanced learning algorithm that optimizes memory retention through personalized review scheduling based on individual learning patterns and cognitive science principles.

## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Algorithm
- **Personalized Intervals**: Dynamically adjusts review intervals based on individual performance
- **Learning Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes user learning patterns to optimize review scheduling
- **Multi-factor Adaptation**: Considers time spent, error patterns, and content difficulty
- **Retention Targeting**: Aims for optimal retention rate while minimizing review time

### 2. Learning Insights
- **Performance Analytics**: Visualizes learning performance and retention rates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies difficult topics and optimal review times
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored suggestions to improve learning efficiency
- **Review Forecasting**: Shows upcoming review load and distribution

### 3. Customizable Settings
- **Algorithm Parameters**: Fine-tune the algorithm to match learning preferences
- **Retention Targets**: Set desired retention rates based on learning goals
- **Adaptive Factors**: Control how much each factor influences the algorithm
- **Learning Stages**: Customize progression through learning, review, and mastery stages

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **AdaptiveAlgorithm Service**
   - Implements the core adaptive algorithm
   - Analyzes learning patterns
   - Provides personalized settings

2. **SpacedRepetitionService**
   - Manages review sessions and items
   - Tracks review history and performance
   - Integrates with the adaptive algorithm

3. **UI Components**
   - FlashcardReview: Interactive review interface
   - AdaptiveSettings: Algorithm configuration
   - LearningInsights: Performance visualization

### Database Schema

The system uses the following tables:
- `study_items`: Stores the content to be learned
- `review_sessions`: Tracks review sessions
- `item_reviews`: Records individual item reviews
- `learning_parameters`: Stores user-specific algorithm parameters
- `study_decks`: Organizes items into decks
- `deck_items`: Maps items to decks

### Algorithm Details

The adaptive algorithm is based on the SM-2 algorithm with significant enhancements:

1. **Base Interval Calculation**
   - For correct responses: interval = previous_interval * ease_factor
   - For incorrect responses: reset to learning phase

2. **Adaptive Factors**
   - Time Factor: Adjusts based on time spent vs. expected time
   - Error Factor: Increases frequency for items with high error rates
   - Difficulty Weight: Adjusts based on content difficulty
   - Retention Factor: Targets optimal retention rate

3. **Learning Stages**
   - New: First exposure to the item
   - Learning: Initial acquisition phase
   - Review: Long-term retention phase
   - Mastery: Extended retention phase
