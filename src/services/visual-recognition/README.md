### Database Schema

The system uses the following tables:
- `visual_recognition_images`: Stores uploaded images
- `visual_recognition_results`: Stores recognition results
- `visual_recognition_text`: Stores extracted text
- `visual_recognition_formulas`: Stores recognized formulas
- `visual_recognition_annotations`: Stores user annotations
- `visual_recognition_tags`: Stores image tags
- `visual_recognition_objects`: Stores detected objects

### Recognition Process

1. **Image Upload**
   - User uploads or captures an image
   - Image is stored and prepared for processing

2. **Pre-processing**
   - Image is enhanced and optimized
   - Content type is detected (text, formula, diagram, etc.)

3. **Recognition**
   - Specialized recognition algorithms are applied
   - Results are extracted and structured

4. **Post-processing**
   - Results are refined and formatted
   - Confidence scores are calculated

5. **Study Material Generation**
   - Recognized content is converted to study materials
   - Materials are integrated with the learning system

## Usage
