### For Developers

1. **Initialize Services**
   ```javascript
   const learningProfile = useLearningProfile();
   await learningProfile.initialize(userId);
   
   const recommendations = useRecommendations();
   await recommendations.initialize(userId);
   ```

2. **Get User Profile**
   ```javascript
   const profile = await learningProfile.getProfile();
   ```

3. **Generate Recommendations**
   ```javascript
   await recommendations.generateRecommendations();
   const userRecommendations = await recommendations.getRecommendations();
   ```

4. **Analyze Content**
   ```javascript
   const contentAnalysis = useContentAnalysis();
   await contentAnalysis.initialize(userId);
   
   const analysis = contentAnalysis.analyzeTextContent(text);
   ```

5. **Log Learning Activity**
   ```javascript
   await learningProfile.logActivity({
     activityType: 'view',
     contentId: 'content-123',
     contentType: 'article',
     duration: 300,
     engagementLevel: 4
   });
   ```

## Recommendation Algorithms

The system uses several algorithms to generate personalized recommendations:

### 1. Topic-Based Recommendations
Matches content with topics the user has expressed interest in, weighted by interest level.

### 2. Activity-Based Recommendations
Suggests content related to the user's recent learning activities, finding materials with similar topics.

### 3. Learning Style Recommendations
Recommends content formats that match the user's dominant learning style (visual, auditory, reading, kinesthetic).

### 4. Goal-Aligned Recommendations
Provides content that helps users progress toward their stated learning goals.

## Future Enhancements
