# Knowledge Visualization System

The Knowledge Visualization System is a powerful tool for creating, visualizing, and navigating complex knowledge structures. It helps users organize information, understand relationships between concepts, and create personalized learning paths.

## Key Features

### 1. Knowledge Maps
- Create interactive visual maps of knowledge domains
- Organize concepts and their relationships
- Collaborate with others on shared maps
- Visualize complex information structures

### 2. Concept Graphs
- Analyze relationships between concepts
- Find connections and paths between ideas
- Identify central concepts and knowledge gaps
- Generate insights from knowledge structures

### 3. Learning Paths
- Create sequential learning journeys through knowledge maps
- Track progress through learning materials
- Generate personalized learning paths based on knowledge maps
- Optimize learning sequences for better understanding

## Technical Implementation

### Core Services

1. **KnowledgeMapService**
   - Manages creation and editing of knowledge maps
   - Handles concepts and relationships
   - Provides collaboration features
   - Supports map sharing and permissions

2. **ConceptGraphService**
   - Analyzes concept graphs for insights
   - Finds paths and relationships between concepts
   - Generates concept maps from text
   - Provides graph metrics and analysis

3. **LearningPathService**
   - Creates and manages learning paths
   - Tracks user progress through paths
   - Generates optimal learning sequences
   - Provides path recommendations

### Database Schema

The system uses the following tables:
- `knowledge_maps`: Stores map information and metadata
- `concepts`: Stores individual concepts within maps
- `relationships`: Tracks relationships between concepts
- `learning_paths`: Manages learning paths
- `path_nodes`: Stores nodes within learning paths
- `user_progress`: Tracks user progress through maps and paths
- `map_tags`: Stores tags for knowledge maps
- `map_collaborators`: Manages map sharing and permissions

### Visualization Components

The system includes specialized visualization components:
- Interactive graph visualization
- Force-directed layout algorithms
- Zoom and pan navigation
- Relationship highlighting
- Path visualization
- Progress tracking visualization

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Create Knowledge Maps**
   - Visually organize concepts and ideas
   - Define relationships between concepts
   - Add rich content to concepts
   - Share maps with collaborators

2. **Analyze Concept Graphs**
   - Identify central concepts
   - Find connections between ideas
   - Discover knowledge gaps
   - Generate insights from knowledge structures

3. **Create Learning Paths**
   - Define sequential learning journeys
   - Track progress through learning materials
   - Generate paths from existing maps
   - Optimize learning sequences

### For Developers

1. **Initialize Services**
   ```javascript
   const knowledgeMap = useKnowledgeMap();
   await knowledgeMap.initialize(userId);
   ```

2. **Create a Knowledge Map**
   ```javascript
   const map = await knowledgeMap.createMap({
     title: "Map Title",
     description: "Map description",
     isPublic: true
   });
   ```

3. **Add Concepts and Relationships**
   ```javascript
   const concept1 = await knowledgeMap.addConcept(mapId, {
     title: "Concept 1",
     positionX: 100,
     positionY: 200
   });
   
   const concept2 = await knowledgeMap.addConcept(mapId, {
     title: "Concept 2",
     positionX: 300,
     positionY: 200
   });
   
   await knowledgeMap.addRelationship(mapId, {
     sourceId: concept1.id,
     targetId: concept2.id,
     relationshipType: "depends_on"
   });
   ```

4. **Analyze a Graph**
   ```javascript
   const conceptGraph = useConceptGraph();
   await conceptGraph.initialize(userId);
   
   const analysis = await conceptGraph.analyzeGraph(mapId);
   ```

5. **Create a Learning Path**
   ```javascript
   const learningPath = useLearningPath();
   await learningPath.initialize(userId);
   
   const path = await learningPath.generateFromMap(mapId);
   ```

## Future Enhancements
