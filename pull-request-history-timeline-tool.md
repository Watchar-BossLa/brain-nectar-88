- **HistoricalTimeline Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for visualizing historical events and periods, including features for filtering by time period, region, and search terms
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between History and other subjects like Literature, Archaeology, Data Science, Mathematics, and more
- **Subject Components**: Updated the SubjectIntegration component with connections for History
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the History page
