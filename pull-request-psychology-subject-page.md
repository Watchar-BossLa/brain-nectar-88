# Implement Psychology Subject Page with Cognitive Assessment Tool

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Psychology subject page with a specialized CognitiveAssessment component and enhanced cross-subject connections. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to expand the multi-subject capabilities of the application with specialized tools for each subject.

## Key Changes

- **Psychology Subject Page**: Created a dedicated page for Psychology with topics including Cognitive Psychology, Social Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Behavioral Psychology, and Positive Psychology
- **CognitiveAssessment Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for assessing cognitive functions like memory, attention, and processing speed
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between Psychology and other subjects like Neuroscience, Computer Science, Philosophy, Sociology, and more
- **Subject Components**: Created reusable components for subject dashboards and cross-subject integration
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Psychology page

## Technical Details

- The CognitiveAssessment component provides multiple features:
  - Multiple Test Types: Memory Assessment, Attention Assessment, and Processing Speed tests
  - Interactive Test Interface: Engaging tasks for measuring cognitive functions
  - Detailed Results: Comprehensive analysis of performance with scores, percentiles, and recommendations
  - Strengths and Weaknesses: Identification of cognitive strengths and areas for improvement
- The assessment includes various cognitive tasks:
  - Memory tasks: Word recall, pattern memorization
  - Attention tasks: Continuous performance test, Stroop test
  - Processing speed tasks: Reaction time, digit-symbol coding
- The component adapts its difficulty and provides personalized feedback based on performance

## Testing

- Verified that the Psychology page renders correctly
- Tested the CognitiveAssessment component with sample tasks
- Confirmed that the test progression and scoring work properly
- Validated that the results display correctly
- Verified that the cross-subject connections display properly
- Tested that the navigation works correctly

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing additional specialized tools for Psychology (Personality Profiler, Behavior Tracker)
2. Adding more cognitive assessment tasks and improving the existing ones
3. Implementing adaptive difficulty based on user performance
4. Adding more detailed analysis and personalized recommendations
5. Integrating with the spaced repetition system for cognitive training
