# Implement Economics Subject Page with Market Simulator Tool

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Economics subject page with a specialized MarketSimulator component and enhanced cross-subject connections. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to expand the multi-subject capabilities of the application with specialized tools for each subject.

## Key Changes

- **Economics Subject Page**: Created a dedicated page for Economics with topics including Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, International Economics, Financial Economics, Development Economics, and Behavioral Economics
- **MarketSimulator Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for simulating market dynamics and economic principles
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between Economics and other subjects like Mathematics, Psychology, Business, History, Political Science, and more
- **Subject Components**: Created reusable components for subject dashboards and cross-subject integration
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Economics page

## Technical Details

- The MarketSimulator component provides multiple features:
  - Supply and Demand Visualization: Interactive visualization of supply and demand curves
  - Market Parameters: Adjustable parameters for demand intercept, demand slope, supply intercept, and supply slope
  - Market Interventions: Simulation of government interventions like taxes, subsidies, price floors, and price ceilings
  - Market Analysis: Calculation and visualization of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss
  - Data Table: Tabular representation of supply and demand data
- The component adapts its calculations and visualizations based on user inputs, providing real-time feedback on market dynamics
- The implementation includes different market types (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition)

## Testing

- Verified that the Economics page renders correctly
- Tested the MarketSimulator component with various parameter settings
- Confirmed that the market interventions work properly
- Validated that the calculations for equilibrium price, quantity, and surpluses are correct
- Verified that the cross-subject connections display properly
- Tested that the navigation works correctly

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing additional specialized tools for Economics (Economic Data Analyzer, Policy Simulator)
2. Adding more advanced market models to the MarketSimulator
3. Implementing interactive visualizations for the supply and demand curves
4. Adding more detailed economic data and analysis
5. Integrating with real-world economic data sources
