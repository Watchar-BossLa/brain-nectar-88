# Implement Art Subject Page with StyleAnalyzer Component

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Art subject page with a specialized StyleAnalyzer component for analyzing artistic styles, techniques, and color palettes. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to expand the multi-subject capabilities of the application with specialized tools for each subject.

## Key Changes

- **Art Subject Page**: Created a dedicated page for Art with topics including Art History, Art Techniques, Art Analysis, Visual Elements, Art Appreciation, and Creative Process
- **StyleAnalyzer Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for analyzing artistic styles, techniques, and color palettes
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between Art and other subjects like History, Psychology, Mathematics, Physics, and more
- **Subject Components**: Created reusable components for subject dashboards and cross-subject integration
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Art page

## Technical Details

- The StyleAnalyzer component provides multiple features:
  - Artwork Gallery: Selection of famous artworks for analysis
  - Style Analysis: Detailed analysis of artistic styles and movements
  - Technique Analysis: Identification and explanation of artistic techniques
  - Color Palette Analysis: Breakdown of color usage and composition
  - Historical Context: Information about the historical and cultural context of artworks
- The component includes tabs for different aspects of analysis (style, techniques, colors)
- The implementation includes sample data for three famous artworks (Starry Night, The Persistence of Memory, Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow)
- The Art page integrates with the SubjectIntegration component to show connections to other subjects

## Testing

- Verified that the Art page renders correctly
- Tested the StyleAnalyzer component with sample artworks
- Confirmed that the style, technique, and color analysis features work properly
- Validated that the cross-subject connections display properly
- Verified that the navigation works correctly

2. Adding more artworks and artistic styles to the StyleAnalyzer
3. Implementing interactive features for creating and analyzing user-uploaded artwork
4. Adding more detailed art history content and timelines
5. Integrating with external art databases and resources
