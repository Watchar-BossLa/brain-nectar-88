# Implement Additional Subject Pages

## Overview

This PR implements additional subject pages for Computer Science and Biology, which is part of Phase 3 of our enhancement plan. These new subject pages follow the same structure as the existing ones (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, etc.) and include cross-subject integration.

## Key Changes

- **Computer Science Page**: Created a comprehensive page with topics including Programming Fundamentals, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems, Databases, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence
- **Biology Page**: Implemented a page covering Cell Biology, Genetics, Ecology, Physiology, Evolution, and Biochemistry
- **Molecular Viewer Component**: Created a component for visualizing 3D molecular structures in the Chemistry page
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the new subject pages
- **Cross-Subject Integration**: Ensured all new pages include the SubjectIntegration component for showing connections between subjects

## Testing

- Verified that the Computer Science page renders correctly
- Confirmed that the Biology page displays properly
- Tested the Molecular Viewer component functionality
- Validated that the navigation between subjects works correctly
- Verified that the modal functionality works properly
- Tested that the cross-subject integration displays relevant connections

## Future Work

The next steps in Phase 3 include:
1. Implementing additional subject pages (Economics, History, etc.)
2. Enhancing the cross-subject integration with more detailed connections
3. Adding more interactive tools for each subject
