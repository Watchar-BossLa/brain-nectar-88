# Implement Geography Subject Page with Interactive Map

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Geography subject page with a specialized InteractiveMap component and enhanced cross-subject connections. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to expand the multi-subject capabilities of the application with specialized tools for each subject.

## Key Changes

- **Geography Subject Page**: Created a dedicated page for Geography with topics including Physical Geography, Human Geography, Cartography, Climatology, Regional Geography, and Geographic Techniques
- **InteractiveMap Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for exploring geographic features and regions, including features for selecting map types, filtering regions, and viewing detailed information
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between Geography and other subjects like Geology, Physics, Environmental Science, Sociology, Economics, and more
- **Subject Components**: Created reusable components for subject dashboards and cross-subject integration
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Geography page

## Technical Details

- The InteractiveMap component provides multiple features:
  - Map Type Selection: Physical, Political, and Climate maps
  - Region Filtering: Filter by continent or region
  - Search Functionality: Search for specific regions or features
  - Zoom Controls: Adjust the map view scale
  - Region Details: View comprehensive information about geographic regions and features
- The map visualization includes:
  - Continent outlines with interactive selection
  - Physical features like mountains and rivers
  - Labels for major geographic features
  - Detailed region information including population, area, and climate

## Testing

- Verified that the Geography page renders correctly
- Tested the InteractiveMap component with sample data
- Confirmed that the filtering and search functionality works properly
- Validated that the map visualization displays regions correctly
- Verified that the cross-subject connections display properly
- Tested that the navigation works correctly

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing additional specialized tools for Geography (Climate Data Visualizer, Demographic Analyzer)
2. Adding more detailed geographic data to the interactive map
3. Implementing GIS functionality for more advanced spatial analysis
4. Adding interactive features like map annotations and sharing
