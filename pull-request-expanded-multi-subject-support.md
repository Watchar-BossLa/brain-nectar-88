# Implement Expanded Multi-Subject Support

## Overview

This PR implements the Expanded Multi-Subject Support feature, which is the third and final feature in Phase 2 of our enhancement plan. This feature enhances the multi-subject capabilities of the application by providing a central Subject Hub and cross-subject integration.

## Key Changes

- **SubjectIntegration Component**: Implemented a component that shows connections between concepts across different subjects
- **SubjectSelector Component**: Created a component for easily navigating between subjects
- **SubjectDashboard Component**: Implemented a comprehensive dashboard for each subject
- **Subject Pages**: Updated Mathematics and Physics pages to include the new components
- **Navigation**: Added Subject Hub to the main navigation
- **Routing**: Updated routes to include the Subject Hub and subject pages

## Testing

- Verified that the Subject Hub page renders correctly
- Tested navigation between subjects using the SubjectSelector
- Confirmed that the SubjectDashboard displays subject information correctly
- Validated that the SubjectIntegration component shows cross-subject connections
- Verified that the modal functionality works correctly
- Tested that the navigation links work properly
