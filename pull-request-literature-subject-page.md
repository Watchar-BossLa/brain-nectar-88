## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Literature subject page with a specialized TextAnalyzer component and enhanced cross-subject connections. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to expand the multi-subject capabilities of the application.

## Key Changes

- **Literature Subject Page**: Created a dedicated page for Literature with topics including Fiction, Poetry, Drama, Literary Analysis, World Literature, and Creative Writing
- **TextAnalyzer Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for analyzing literary texts, including features for identifying literary devices, theme analysis, style metrics, and character analysis
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between Literature and other subjects like Psychology, History, Philosophy, Mathematics, and more
- **Subject Components**: Created reusable components for subject dashboards and cross-subject integration
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Literature page

## Technical Details

- The TextAnalyzer component provides multiple analysis types:
  - Literary Devices: Identifies metaphors, imagery, alliteration, and other devices
  - Theme Analysis: Identifies themes and their evidence in the text
  - Style Metrics: Analyzes word count, sentence structure, readability, and vocabulary
  - Character Analysis: Identifies characters, their traits, and relationships
- The SubjectIntegration component now includes detailed connections for Literature concepts
- The SubjectDashboard component provides progress tracking and topic organization
