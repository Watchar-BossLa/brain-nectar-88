# Implement Adaptive Spaced Repetition System with SM-2 Algorithm

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Adaptive Spaced Repetition System using the scientifically-proven SM-2 algorithm. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to enhance the learning experience with advanced, evidence-based learning techniques that optimize knowledge retention and recall.

## Key Changes

- **SpacedRepetitionSystem Component**: Created a specialized component for adaptive learning with spaced repetition
- **SM-2 Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented the SuperMemo-2 algorithm for optimizing review intervals based on user performance
- **Interactive Flashcard Interface**: Developed an intuitive interface for reviewing flashcards with difficulty rating
- **Learning Analytics Dashboard**: Added a dashboard for tracking learning progress, mastery level, and upcoming reviews
- **Flashcard Management**: Created tools for managing flashcards across different subjects and topics
- **Dedicated Page**: Added a dedicated page showcasing the spaced repetition system and its scientific basis
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the SpacedRepetition page

## Technical Details

- The SpacedRepetitionSystem component provides multiple features:
  - Study Session: Interactive flashcard review with difficulty rating
  - Dashboard: Visual analytics of learning progress and upcoming reviews
  - Card Management: Tools for organizing and managing flashcards
- The SM-2 algorithm implementation includes:
  - Dynamic interval calculation based on performance
  - Ease factor adjustment for each card
  - Repetition tracking for mastery level calculation
  - Optimal scheduling of reviews to maximize retention
- The component adapts to user performance, focusing more attention on difficult cards and spacing out reviews of well-known cards

## Testing

- Verified that the SpacedRepetition page renders correctly
- Tested the flashcard review functionality with sample cards
- Confirmed that the SM-2 algorithm correctly calculates review intervals
- Validated that the dashboard displays accurate learning analytics
- Verified that the card management tools work properly
- Tested that the navigation works correctly

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing import/export functionality for flashcards
2. Adding support for multimedia content in flashcards (images, audio, etc.)
3. Implementing cross-subject learning paths based on spaced repetition data
4. Adding more detailed analytics and learning insights
5. Integrating with other learning tools like the Knowledge Graph
