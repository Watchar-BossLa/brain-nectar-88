# Add Interactive Mechanics Simulator to Physics Page

## Overview

This PR implements the Interactive Mechanics Simulator for the Physics page, which is the second feature in Phase 1 of our enhancement plan. The simulator allows users to visualize and experiment with various mechanics concepts including projectile motion, collisions, and simple harmonic motion.

## Key Changes

- **MechanicsSimulator Component**: Created a main component that integrates all simulations
- **Simulation Components**: Implemented ProjectileMotion, CollisionSimulator, and HarmonicMotion components
- **Physics Engine Integration**: Integrated the matter.js physics engine for realistic simulations
- **Interactive Controls**: Added controls for adjusting simulation parameters
- **Physics Data Visualization**: Added displays for relevant physics data
- **Physics Page Update**: Updated the Physics page to include the MechanicsSimulator
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for the MechanicsSimulator
- **Unit Tests**: Added unit tests for the MechanicsSimulator component

## Testing

- Verified that the MechanicsSimulator component renders correctly
- Tested switching between different simulations
- Confirmed that the play/pause functionality works correctly
- Validated that the settings panel can be toggled
- Tested that the simulations respond to parameter changes
- Verified that physics data is displayed correctly

## Future Work

The next steps in the implementation plan are:
1. Implement the Interactive Periodic Table for Chemistry
2. Implement the Interactive Data Visualization Studio for Data Science
3. Implement the Interactive Investment Portfolio Simulator for Finance
