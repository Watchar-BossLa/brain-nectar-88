# Implement Music Subject Page with MusicAnalyzer Component

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Music subject page with a specialized MusicAnalyzer component for analyzing musical compositions, theory, and historical context. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to expand the multi-subject capabilities of the application with specialized tools for each subject.

## Key Changes

- **Music Subject Page**: Created a dedicated page for Music with topics including Music Theory, Music History, Music Analysis, Composition, Music Appreciation, and Music and Society
- **MusicAnalyzer Component**: Implemented a specialized tool for analyzing musical compositions, theory, and historical context
- **Enhanced Cross-Subject Connections**: Added detailed connections between Music and other subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, History, and more
- **Subject Components**: Created reusable components for subject dashboards and cross-subject integration
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Music page

## Technical Details

- The MusicAnalyzer component provides multiple features:
  - Composition Gallery: Selection of famous musical compositions for analysis
  - Audio Playback: Integrated audio player for listening to musical examples
  - Form Analysis: Analysis of musical structure and organization
  - Harmonic Analysis: Analysis of chord progressions and tonal structure
  - Melodic Analysis: Analysis of themes and melodic characteristics
  - Historical Context: Information about the historical significance and reception of compositions
- The component includes tabs for different aspects of analysis (form, harmony, melody, historical)
- The implementation includes sample data for three famous compositions (Moonlight Sonata, The Four Seasons - Spring, Prelude in C Major)
- The Music page integrates with the SubjectIntegration component to show connections to other subjects

## Testing

- Verified that the Music page renders correctly
- Tested the MusicAnalyzer component with sample compositions
- Confirmed that the audio playback functionality works properly
- Validated that the form, harmony, melody, and historical analysis features display correctly
- Verified that the cross-subject connections display properly
- Tested that the navigation works correctly

1. Implementing additional specialized tools for Music (Ear Training, Composition Workshop)
2. Adding more compositions and musical styles to the MusicAnalyzer
3. Implementing interactive features for creating and analyzing user-uploaded compositions
4. Adding more detailed music theory content and exercises
5. Integrating with external music databases and resources
