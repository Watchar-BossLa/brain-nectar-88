# Implement Enhanced Visual Recognition System with Multi-Subject Capabilities

## Overview

This PR implements an enhanced Visual Recognition System with multi-subject capabilities, allowing users to learn through visual identification and analysis across various subjects including Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Art, and Geography. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to improve cross-subject integration and provide specialized tools for different learning modalities.

## Key Changes

- **Visual Recognition System Page**: Created a comprehensive page for the visual recognition system with subject-specific configurations
- **Subject-Specific Recognition**: Implemented specialized recognition models for different subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Art, Geography)
- **Multi-Step Recognition Process**: Created a workflow for capturing, analyzing, and studying visual content
- **Integration with Existing Components**: Enhanced integration with existing visual recognition components
- **SubjectSpecificRecognition Component**: Added a new component for handling recognition tasks specific to different subjects
- **App Routing**: Updated routes to include the Visual Recognition System page

## Technical Details

- The Visual Recognition System provides multiple features:
  - Subject Selection: Users can select from different subjects for specialized recognition
  - Camera Capture: Capture images using the device's camera
  - Image Upload: Upload images from the device
  - Image Gallery: Browse and select from previously captured or uploaded images
  - Image Analysis: Analyze images using subject-specific recognition models
  - Results Visualization: View detailed recognition results with confidence scores
  - Study Material Generation: Generate study materials based on recognition results
- The SubjectSpecificRecognition component includes:
  - Subject-specific recognition models with accuracy metrics
  - Recognition progress visualization
  - Detailed results display for different types of content (cells, formulas, expressions, artwork, landforms)
  - Contextual information and tips for each subject

## Testing

- Verified that the Visual Recognition System page renders correctly
- Tested the subject selection functionality
- Confirmed that the recognition workflow works properly
- Validated that the subject-specific recognition models display correctly
- Verified that the integration with existing components works properly
- Tested that the navigation works correctly

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing real machine learning models for visual recognition
2. Adding more subjects and specialized recognition models
3. Enhancing the study material generation with more detailed content
4. Implementing a history feature to track recognition activities
5. Adding collaborative features for sharing and discussing recognition results
