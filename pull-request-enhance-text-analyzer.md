# Enhance TextAnalyzer Component with Advanced Analysis Features

## Overview

This PR enhances the TextAnalyzer component with advanced analysis features, improved visualizations, and a more comprehensive user interface. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to enhance existing specialized tools for each subject.

## Key Changes

- **Enhanced Analysis Types**: Added support for four distinct analysis types:
  - Literary Devices Analysis
  - Theme Analysis
  - Style Metrics
  - Character Analysis
- **Advanced Options**: Added configurable analysis depth (Basic, Standard, Deep) and output formats (Summary, Detailed, Academic)
- **Improved Visualizations**: Added data visualizations for each analysis type
- **Text Annotations**: Added support for annotating text with identified literary elements
- **Sample Texts**: Added sample literary texts for quick analysis

## Technical Details

- The enhanced TextAnalyzer component provides multiple features:
  - Text Input: Enter or paste text, or load sample texts
  - Analysis Options: Select analysis type, depth, and output format
  - Results Display: View detailed analysis results with confidence scores
  - Visualizations: View graphical representations of analysis results
  - Annotations: View annotated text with identified literary elements
- The analysis results include:
  - Literary Devices: Metaphors, imagery, alliteration, symbolism, etc.
  - Themes: Identified themes with evidence and relevance scores
  - Style Metrics: Word count, sentence structure, vocabulary analysis, etc.
  - Character Analysis: Character identification, traits, relationships, etc.
- The component adapts its output based on the selected analysis depth:
  - Basic: Essential information only
  - Standard: More detailed analysis with confidence scores
  - Deep: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations and additional insights

## Testing

- Verified that the TextAnalyzer component renders correctly
- Tested all analysis types with sample texts
- Confirmed that the analysis depth and output format options work properly
- Validated that the visualizations display correctly
- Tested the text annotation feature

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing real NLP analysis instead of mock data
2. Adding support for comparing multiple texts
3. Implementing export functionality for analysis results
4. Adding more advanced visualizations
5. Integrating with external literary databases for more comprehensive analysis
