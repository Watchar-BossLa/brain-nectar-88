# Enhance Cross-Subject Integration

## Overview

This PR enhances the cross-subject integration feature with a knowledge graph visualization, which is part of Phase 3 of our enhancement plan. This improvement allows users to visualize connections between concepts across different subjects, making it easier to understand interdisciplinary relationships.

## Key Changes

- **KnowledgeGraph Component**: Created a new component for visualizing connections between concepts across subjects
- **Enhanced SubjectIntegration Component**: Updated the component to include both list and graph views of cross-subject connections
- **SubjectDashboard Component**: Implemented a comprehensive dashboard for each subject with progress tracking
- **SubjectSelector Component**: Created a component for easily navigating between subjects
- **Enhanced SubjectHub Page**: Updated the page with more detailed subject information and cross-subject connections
- **Concept Connections Data**: Added sample data for concept connections across subjects

## Technical Details

- The KnowledgeGraph component uses a canvas-based visualization to show connections between concepts
- The visualization supports different layout types, zooming, and filtering
- The SubjectIntegration component now has two view modes: list and graph
- The SubjectHub page includes tabs for different subject categories and a dedicated tab for subject connections

## Testing

- Verified that the KnowledgeGraph component renders correctly
- Confirmed that the SubjectIntegration component displays both list and graph views
- Tested the interactive features of the knowledge graph (zooming, filtering, etc.)
- Validated that the SubjectHub page displays all subjects and their connections
- Verified that the navigation between subjects works correctly

## Screenshots

## Future Work

The next steps in Phase 3 include:
1. Implementing more detailed concept connections across all subjects
2. Adding interactive tools for exploring the knowledge graph
3. Integrating the knowledge graph with the user's learning progress
