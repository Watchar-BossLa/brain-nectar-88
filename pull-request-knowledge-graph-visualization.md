# Implement Knowledge Graph Visualization for Cross-Subject Connections

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive Knowledge Graph visualization component for exploring connections between subjects and concepts. This is part of our Phase 3 plan to improve cross-subject integration and provide more interactive ways for users to explore the relationships between different fields of knowledge.

## Key Changes

- **KnowledgeGraph Component**: Created a specialized component for visualizing connections between subjects and concepts
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Implemented an interactive canvas-based graph visualization with zooming, panning, and selection capabilities
- **Force-Directed Layout**: Added physics-based layout algorithms for automatically arranging nodes and edges
- **Multiple Layout Options**: Implemented radial, force-directed, and hierarchical layout options
- **Enhanced SubjectIntegration**: Updated the SubjectIntegration component to use the KnowledgeGraph component for the graph view
- **Detailed Node Information**: Added a panel for displaying detailed information about selected nodes and their connections

## Technical Details

- The KnowledgeGraph component provides multiple features:
  - Interactive Canvas: Users can zoom, pan, and select nodes in the graph
  - Multiple Layouts: Radial, force-directed, and hierarchical layouts for different visualization needs
  - Physics Simulation: Force-directed layout with repulsive and attractive forces for natural node arrangement
  - Node Selection: Users can select nodes to see detailed information about concepts and their connections
  - Filtering: Options to show all connections or focus on selected nodes
  - Export: Users can export the graph as an image
- The graph visualization includes:
  - Color-coding by subject
  - Different node sizes for subjects and concepts
  - Edge styling to indicate relationship types
  - Labels for nodes with background for better readability
  - Detailed information panel for selected nodes

## Testing

- Verified that the KnowledgeGraph component renders correctly
- Tested the interactive features including zooming, panning, and node selection
- Confirmed that the force-directed layout works properly
- Validated that the different layout options display correctly
- Verified that the node selection and information display work properly
- Tested the integration with the SubjectIntegration component

## Future Work

The next steps include:
1. Implementing more advanced filtering options for the graph
2. Adding animation for transitions between different layouts
3. Implementing clustering algorithms for grouping related concepts
4. Adding search functionality within the graph
5. Implementing path finding to show the shortest path between concepts
